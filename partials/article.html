                <h2>The Value Of Money</h2>

                <p>Money is a dependent variable that affects the many decisions people make in their lives, ranging from collegiate enrollment and job decisions to simple/major investments. Inadvertently or intentionally we make some of our biggest life decisions in accordance with money. But what makes money so fascinating? Perhaps it’s the idea that these multi-colored bills and coins in our wallets allow us to set occupational goals for future successes or squander them.</p>
                <p>The value of money changes in the hands of its possessor but not in a physical manner, but a metaphysical one. As an abstract value money is infinitely malleable, represented as a symbolic entity of power, greed, happiness, security, potential and status. As purchasing or buying becomes an infinite choice, very similarly wealth takes on an infinitely different meaning in the eyes of its beholder. The influence of money is a product of its owner and its use.</p>

                <h2>GMO(Genetically Modified) Foods</h2>

                <p>A genetically modified food is a food product derived in whole or part from a genetically modified organism (GMO) such as a crop plant, animal or microbe such as yeast. Genetically modified foods have been available since the 1990s. The principal ingredients of GM foods currently available are derived from genetically modified soybean, maize and canola</p>

                <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces, translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate readouts of their heart rate, insulin levels, and other important conditions within their own bodies.</li>
                    <li>Computers will disappear, as will cellphones, clocks, watches, and MP3 players. Chips, costing less than a penny apiece, will be hidden by the millions in the environment. We will be able to command these hidden computers telepathically, directly via the mind. Computers will interpret the electrical signals emitted by our brains, decipher them, and carry out our wishes. When we walk into a room, we will be able to mentally control a computer that in turn will direct the many things around us. Moving heavy furniture, rearranging desks, and brewing a cup of coffee may be possible just by thinking about it. So we will be like the gods of mythology, mentally manipulating the world around us. We will also be able to conjure up almost any object just by wishing for it. This is done via “programmable matter,” which consists of millions of microscopic computer chips, which are intelligent and can be programmed to suddenly rearrange themselves into any shape or object on command, so that we will be able to create almost anything we can imagine (this is very similar to the Replicator from “Star Trek”).</li>
                    <li>Our cars will be driver-less, using GPS to navigate without the help of an alert human behind the wheel. These cars will also fly (finally!) by floating on a cushion of magnetism. With room-temperature superconducting magnets, our cars and trains will glide effortlessly in the air without bumps or potholes to worry about since the crafts hover over the treacherous road. Traffic jams and accidents will be a thing of the past as a central computer will be able to track the motions of all the cars on the road (or air), while each car will use radar in its fenders to sense obstacles and take emergency measures as soon as it senses an impending accident. Best of all, we will hardly ever need to fuel up, since there is almost no friction to slow us down. This will also solve the energy crisis, since most energy is wasted, strangely enough, on overcoming the friction of the road.</li>
